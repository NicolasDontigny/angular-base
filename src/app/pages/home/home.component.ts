          description: "Mazama is a small village, probably the last stop before the border, or first stop if you're sobo. There is a nice caf√© to eat, and the store next to it has some food to make a full resupply although a bit limited and very expensive. Mazama is a favorite simply because of the Lion's Den, a trail angel hosting place that allowed me to get all the information about the trail conditions and alternate route last year. There are a few beds or a lot of camping spots, there's a full kitchen, shower, laundry, and Mary is an amazing host that even cooked some meals or deserts for everyone a few times a week. You can also get a ride or hitch into Winthrop, which has a grocery store and gear shops.",
